So far, each exercise has used a single eBPF program. But what if we need to correlate information across different events?

For example: When a process **starts**, we know its name. When it **exits**, we know its exit code. What if we want to know the **name** of processes that exit with a specific code?

## Multiple eBPF programs

You can define **multiple programs in one file**, each hooking into different events.

Each program is independent and runs when its own event triggers.

A common case that requires multiple programs is the `entry`+`exit` event pair.

At **entry**, we have the input (arguments, process info).

```c
SEC("tracepoint/sched/sched_process_exec")
int on_process_start(struct trace_event_raw_sched_process_exec *ctx) {
    // When the process starts execution
}
```

At **exit**, we have the output (return values, exit codes).

```c
SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_exit")
int on_process_exit(struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter *ctx) {
    // When the process calls exit (program termination)
    // ctx->args[0] contains the exit code
}
```

To correlate both events, we need to persist data between program invocations.

## Persisting state

**Maps** are data structures that persist between eBPF program invocations.

In eBPF, there are [many kinds](https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/map-type/) of maps. For this exercise, we'll use hash maps (key-value store).

Map usage is straightforward. First, declare a struct with these `__uint`/`__type` macros.

```c
struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH);
    __uint(max_entries, 1024);
    __type(key, u64);         // What you use to look up
    __type(value, char[16]);  // What you store
} my_map SEC(".maps");
```

To store, you pass a pointer to the data, which will be copied:
```c
u64 key = 12345;
char value[16] = "hello";
bpf_map_update_elem(&my_map, &key, value, BPF_ANY);
```

To retrieve a pointer to the value:
```c
char *stored = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&my_map, &key);
if (!stored) { // Key not found
    return 0;
}
// Use `stored` (it's a pointer to the char[16] array)
```

To delete an entry from the map:
```c
bpf_map_delete_elem(&my_map, &key);
```

## The challenge

A program named `exit_with_code` will run and exit. Submit its exit code using `SUBMIT_NUM(code)`.

The starter code has most of the logic already, this is an introduction chapter after all.

## Your task

Check if the process name matches `"exit_with_code"`, and if so, submit the exit code.

Use `bpf_strncmp(char* buf, u32 buf_sz, "exit_with_code")` for comparison (returns **0 on match**).
