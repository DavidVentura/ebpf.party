When an eBPF program runs, it's executed in **kernel space**, but with access to information about the
process that triggered the event.

For example, if `bash` triggers an event, your eBPF program can query details about that `bash` 
process context: its name, process id, etc.

The kernel defines a [large set of helper functions](https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/helper-function/)
to retrieve this information about the triggering process.

## The challenge

We want to extract the name of every program that executes in the system.

To do this, we need to attach our code to an event that fires whenever a new process is scheduled to run.
This event is called `sched_process_exec`.

In the preloaded snippet, you will see a specific "section" definition just above our function:

```c
SEC("tp/sched/sched_process_exec")
```
This macro tells the eBPF loader to attach the function to that specific tracepoint.
Now, whenever the scheduler runs a new process, our code runs too!


**Try running the preloaded snippet now.** It should log an entry per event.

### Getting the program name

The example code works, but it prints a static string. We want the actual program name for every execution.

Since our code has access to information about the new process, we can ask the kernel: "Who am I?"

We will use [bpf_get_current_comm(&buf, size)](https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/helper-function/bpf_get_current_comm/)
which writes the current process name into a buffer you provide.

In C, we can declare a character buffer with:
```c
char buffer[16];
```

To populate the buffer with the current process name, call the helper function:

```c
bpf_get_current_comm(&buffer, sizeof(buffer));
```

Then call `DEBUG_STR` to see the results:

```c
DEBUG_STR("Command", buffer);
```

**Try this now**, you'll see some normal programs like `ls`, and one that stands out.

### Your task

Your task is to **submit the name of the program that stands out**.

To do this, you'll need to filter out the common programs. Use the
[bpf_strncmp(s1, s1_sz, s2)](https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/helper-function/bpf_strncmp/) helper
to compare strings:

- `s1` is your buffer
- `s1_sz` is the size of your buffer
- `s2` must be a string literal (like `"ls"`)
- Returns **0 if they match**

Filter out `"ls"` and `"sudo"`, then use `SUBMIT_STR(buffer)` to submit the suspicious command name.

**Remember:** You can only call `SUBMIT_STR` once in your program. Multiple submissions will invalidate your answer.
