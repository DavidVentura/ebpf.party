The main goal of this platform is to give you both a configured environment and some exercises to get acquainted with eBPF.

The editor compiles your code locally as you type. Compilation errors are highlighted inline. You can change the auto-compile behavior in settings.

Try typing a bunch into the code box and see how it reacts.

Click 'Run' to execute your code on the server.

## Hotkeys

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> will run the code.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on type definitions (`my_struct`, `trace_event_raw_sched_process_exec`) will show a type definition popup

## Debugging utilities

There are multiple `DEBUG_` macros to display data from your programs.
All of these take a label (a string constant) as a first argument.

- `DEBUG_STR(label, buf)` requires a fixed-size buf (eg: `char[64]`)
- `DEBUG_STR_PTR(label, ptr, len)` can take any pointer, but `len` must be a constant
- `DEBUG_NUM(label, num)` can take any number (eg: `u32`, `ssize_t`)
- `DEBUG_STRUCT(label, struct)` can take any struct _by value_

## Submitting answers

To solve the exercises, you will need to submit answers directly from your code.

Use `SUBMIT_NUM(answer)`, `SUBMIT_STR(answer)` or `SUBMIT_STR_LEN(answer, len)`.

You can only submit once in your program. Multiple submissions invalidate all answers.

Trailing null bytes are trimmed, use the `SUBMIT_STR_LEN` variant when you can't guarantee null termination. 

Solve this exercise by uncommenting `SUBMIT_STR("the answer");`
