# How this platform works

When you send a request to the backend (after clicking `Run`), a fresh VM is created to handle your request.

The VM you get has:

  - 0.5vCPU
  - 64MB RAM
  - 8MB, read only, rootfs
  - No network
  - A 500ms self-destruct timer
  - Kernel version 6.18.2

It is quite limited, but this is plenty for the exercises we run.

the code will be compiled into a BPF object file, then a new VM will be created, and your object file will be loaded.
Source -> Clang -> VM -> Loader -> Execute -> Frontend
